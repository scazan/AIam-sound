So to clarify what we discussed on Friday and make sure we are on the same page for the sound section:

(Q1: front right from audience perspective, Q2: front left, Q3: back left, Q4: back right)

Solo:

0.Nea enters, beep scan

Q1: high boop
Q2: low boop
Q3: high and low boop
Q4: wall

0a. This would develop into 'wow wow'/sine wave with time

Duo:
1. Bogi enters, beep scan, wow wow out

1. AI wall and Bogi (to develop movement wise. idea from menacing to playful)

2. Nea comes close to wall, Proximity and Thump in

2. Greeting in thump

3. Proximity + wow wow

Trio
4. Val enter beep scan

4. Grayscale interactive in,  with element beeps in,  wow wow out, Thump always on

Q1: air
Q2: fire
Q3: metal
Q4: water


Idea for further development: heart beat and breath sounds replace elements

e.g.. Q1: breath
Q2: heart
Q3: breath
Q4: heart
